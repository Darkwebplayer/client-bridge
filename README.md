# ðŸŒ‰ Client Bridge

> Simple client communication, zero hassle

It is highly recommended to fork this project and self-host. Just create a `.env` file with `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and create a Supabase storage bucket called 'project-files' and you're done.

## What This Actually Does

Client Bridge is focused on one thing: keeping you and your clients on the same page without all the project management overhead.

### Task Updates
- Quick task notes so clients know what you're working on

### Threaded Discussions

- Both you and your client can participate
- Attach images when needed

### Document Sharing
- Share contracts, invoices, and project files in one place
- No more "I sent it last week" confusion

### Client Access
- Invite clients with a simple link
- Clean interface that works for everyone
- Real-time updates
